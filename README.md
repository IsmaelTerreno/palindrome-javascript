# Palindrome in javascript

It is my own implementation to verify the words of Palindrome with some improvements, I think it works very well. Maybe this could have more performance, but anyway it looks very good for now.

If you see it and you like it, do not hesitate to give me a star or just follow me.

I hope you like it.
